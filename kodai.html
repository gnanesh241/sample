	<h2>kodaikanal</h2>
	<h4>Description:Kodaikanal is home to almost 10 unique waterfalls. The most visited of these are Liril Falls, Bear Shola Falls, Silver Cascade Waterfall, Vattakanal Waterfalls, Fairy Falls, Kumbakkarai Falls, Pambar Falls, and Thalaiyar Falls.
	Although Ooty is the 'Queen of Hill Stations', it has been commercialized excessively by immense tourism. Kodaikanal on the other hand is still untouched to a huge extent and is said to possess a youthful glow. This is a second reason for it being named 'Princess of Hills'.Whether it is for the scenic views, the pleasant weather, the scrumptious food or the peaceful atmosphere, Kodaikanal is worth visiting! There are many things to do and places to visit in Kodaikanal that can make your holiday more fun and memorable.</h4>
